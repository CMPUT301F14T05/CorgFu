In our testcases (UC: 07-09) we used an automated class BogoPicGen.java to 
help generate mock pictures to test how we handled images. 
BogoPicGen.java is directly imported in our code and can be found at:  

    CorgFuAppTesting/srv/ca.ualberta.cs.corgfuapp.test/BogoPicGen.java 

It was directly copied from BogoPicGen/src/es/softwareprocess/BogoPicGen/BogoPicGen.java authored by Abram Hindle found on
